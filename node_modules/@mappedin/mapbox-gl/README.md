## Mappedin-MapboxGL

1. `yarn` - install dependenices
2. `yarn run download` - downlads mapbox-gl
3. `yarn run watch-dev` - builds mapbox in watch mode

(Other build commands in package.json)

### How it works

1. Yarn installs the download script
2. Download script downloads mapbox gl repo to `_mapbox-gl` and yarn installs it's dependencies
3. Our entry point exposes what we need (for dev, use `import mapboxgl from 'mappedin-mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl-dev'`)
4. We re-bundle the package with our custom entry point and publish
